            <p>
                Trees are the lungs of our planet, absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen that is vital for life. Their branches stretch high into the sky, providing shelter for countless animals and insects. Beyond their ecological importance, trees bring beauty to landscapes, with each season offering a new spectacle of color and change. <br>They stand as timeless symbols of resilience, offering a sense of tranquility and connection to nature.
